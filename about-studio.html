                    <p class="history-text">Since their invention, cars have always been subject to aftermarket modification. Both moderate and radical modification have been commemorated in the popular songs Hot Rod Race and Hot Rod Lincoln. The names of Abarth and Cooper appear on models styled after the cars they modified. With support from Ford, renowned engine manufacturer Cosworth went from modifying English Flathead engines for Lotus Sevens to dominating Formula One racing.

                    In the 1970s and 1980s, many Japanese performance cars were never exported outside the Japanese domestic market. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, grey import vehicles of Japanese performance cars, such as the Nissan Skyline,[1][2][3] began to be privately imported into Western Europe and North America. In the United States, this was in direct contrast to domestic car production around the same time, where there was a very small performance aftermarket for domestic compact and economy cars; the focus was instead on sports cars or muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Corvette.
                    
                    Because of their light weight and the increasing availability of inexpensive tuning equipment,[4] tuned economy and compact cars exhibit high performance at a low cost in comparison to dedicated sports cars. As professional sporting and racing with such vehicles increased, so did recreational use of these vehicles. Many drivers would modify their vehicles in an attempt to emulate versions of racing vehicles.

                    <p class="history-text">In the early days, most “tuner cars” had modified engines. Many wanted a stronger engine, so they’d drop another engine into their cars. The most common practice was replacing an engine with a flathead Ford since it was one of the more powerful engines in its day. This method continues today. Whether you choose to rebuild an engine for more horsepower and torque, replace one engine with another – think putting a small-block Chevy in a Mustang or a Jaguar, or adjusting the timing and other functions via a computer in more modern cars.

                    <p class="history-text">Tuner culture means a lot of things to a lot of people. You can say it started in Japan, or America, or even Germany. There's always another side to the story. You can say it's only about certain engine or suspension modifications, but you know there are some awesome mods out there that you've haven't even heard of. You can say it's only about particular brands or body styles, but there's a tuner forum for practically every model ever built. Ultimately, tuner culture is where the cars we love meet the limits of our imaginations. That's something worth celebrating. Let's take a look back at the origins of tuner culture and how it came to be an integral part of the automotive landscape.
